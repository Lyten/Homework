		<h2>Bipolar risk boosted by accumulation of rare versions of genes</h2>
		
		<p>
		A buildup of rare versions of genes that control the activity of nerve cells in the brain increases a person's risk
		for bipolar disorder, researchers suggest in a paper posted online the week of February 16 in Proceedings of the
		National Academy of Sciences.  
		"There are many different variants in many different genes that contribute to the genetic risk," says co-author Jared
		Roach, a geneticist at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. "We think that most people with bipolar disorder
		will have inherited several of theseâ€¦risk variants."</p>

		<p>
		The bulk of a person's risk for bipolar disorder comes from genetics, but only a quarter of that risk can be explained
		by common variations in genes. Roach's team sequenced the genomes of 200 people from 41 families with a history of
		bipolar disorder.
		<i> They then identified 164 rare forms of genes that show up more often in people with the condition.
		People with bipolar disorder had, on average, six of these rare forms, compared with just one, on average, found in
		their healthy relatives and the general population.</i>
		<u>The identified genes control the ability of ions, or charged particles, to enter or leave nerve cells, or neurons.
		This affects neurons ability to pass information through the brain. Some of the gene variants probably increase
		how much neurons fire while others decrease it, the researchers say. Future research will need to explain what
		role these brain changes play in bipolar disorder.</u>

		<h2>For penguins, it is a matter of no taste</h2>
		
		<p>
		Despite their dapper appearance, penguins have remarkably little taste,
		a new study finds.

		<pre>Penguins can't taste bitter, sweet or the savory taste known as umami,
		researchers report February 16 in Current Biology.</pre>
		<em> The jury is still out on whether the birds can taste salty and sour.</em>
		<br> </br>
		
		<pre>The ability to taste depends upon proteins called receptors.
		Those receptors nestle in the outer membrane of cells in the
		taste buds.</pre>
		<sub> Once receptors detect the molecules responsible
		for a particular taste,</sub>
		<sup>the receptors send a message to the
		brain about what's tripping across the tongue.</sup>
